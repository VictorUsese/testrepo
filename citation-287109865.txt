Uchida, Yasuo & Matsuno, Seigo & Ito, Takao & Sakamoto, Makoto. (2015). A proposal for teaching programming through the Five-Step Method. Journal of Robotics, Networking and Artificial Life. 2. 153. 10.2991/jrnal.2015.2.3.4. We have proposed a new method of advancing from CS Unplugged through the new process of CS Plugged to full-fledged computer programming languages, as a means of deepening understanding in computer programming education. We also have proposed a new Five-Step Method consisting of the following steps: Step 1, A CS Unplugged activity; Step 2, A CS Plugged activity; Step 3, A trace table, Step 4, Preparing pseudocode; and Step 5, Writing Java source code.
